# Project-Azure-Face-Api

Makronet internship project.

Project aim is tracking every employees work,break,exit hours then calculating their total weakly work hours with scanning their faces with a camera.
I heavily focus on back-end codes so user interface is simple.

1-You need a azure api key in order to run this project.
2-Create a folder name "package" in project then unzip package 1 and 2 into the package folder
