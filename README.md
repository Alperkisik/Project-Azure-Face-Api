# Project-Azure-Face-Api

Makronet internship project.

Project aim is tracking every employees work,break,exit hours then calculating their total weakly work hours with scanning their faces with a camera.
I heavily focus on back-end codes so user interface is simple.

Note : You need a azure api key in order to run this project.
